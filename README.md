Hi, I’m @naititanwar.
I have a strong interest in robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, aerospace, and web development. These fields inspire me with their potential to shape the future.
I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering at NIT Delhi, where I’m building my skills in programming, problem-solving, and innovative technologies.
I’m eager to collaborate on open-source projects, contribute to coding challenges, and work on impactful web development initiatives.
You can reach me via email at naititanwar@gmail.com or connect with me here on GitHub.
In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with baking recipes and exploring new ideas. I’m also known for asking thought-provoking and curious questions.
